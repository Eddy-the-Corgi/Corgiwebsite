<b>THERE IS NO PEER REVIEW</b> (??? send help) <br><br>

<b>Objectivities</b> <br>
This course, compulsory for Year 1 CHS students, is the college's latest attempt in instilling interdisciplinarity in students. It is usually preallocated to students alongside HSA1000 Asian Interconnections, and DTK1234 Design Thinking. <br> <br>

Pre-recorded lectures last 30 to 45 minutes every week, and can be viewed at any time, explaining simple concepts related to the discipline of the week. Live webinars which act as QnA sessions, conducted on Monday afternoons, last for 1 hour each, with students expected to spend up to 5 minutes afterwards to post a question on the online forum. Tutorials are conducted every fortnight, and last up to 1.5 hours. <br> <br>

There is a reading list. <br> <br>

<b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
This module is basically a field trip to explore the various social science disciplines -- except any content coverage is highly surficial and watered down due to time constraints. I feel that this approach isn't particularly effective in making students genuinely appreciate the various disciplines CHS has to offer, though this may perhaps have been a task doomed to fail due to the module being compulsory in nature. If there was something to genuinely learn from this module, it would probably be general knowledge, ranging from conditioning methods to the mechanisms behind the failures of banks. <br> <br>

Apart from the emphasis on breadth rather than depth, another aspect I didn't like was the weekly forum post. Though I do recognise the importance of open-ended and critical research questions, it felt very stifling and unrewarding to try to come up with an impressive and well-formulated question that would never be answered anyway. In total, there were around 750 students in the module, with 8 weekly forum posts. That amounts to 6000 questions, and 0 answers. <br> <br>

Furthermore, I felt that the framing of critical questioning exercise wasn't presented too clearly. Throughout the module, the lecturers and tutors would consistently remind the students to "post the question online", without emphasising the difference between research and "casual" questions. After all -- not every question needs to be open-ended. At least, I hope "Is the homework due next Monday?" isn't too terrible of a question. In any case, the framing of the exercise is neglectful at best, and sinister at worst, potentially discouraging trivial binary questioning. <br>

Unlike its sibling module HSA1000 Asian Interconnections, this module is explanation-driven, generally introducing concepts before fitting in the various case studies, especially the obligatory link to Singapore's context. This isn't inherently bad or worse, but is something to take note of -- you won't be learning about the instruments of Teochew culture transmission in 20th century Southeast Asia. <br> <br>

<b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>
This module certainly exists. <br> <br>

If you already have a decent foundation in essay-writing, just put in the effort to ask decent open-ended research questions and write two relatively short analytical essays. <br> <br>

If you feel that you are weak at essay-writing, just give it a try and see what happens, I guess. Having to hone your writing skills is an inevitability by hook or by crook, anyway. Or just S/U it if you're overloading in Semester 2. <br> <br>

<b>THERE ARE PEER REVIEWS</b> (yay) <br> <br>

<b>Objectivities</b> <br>
This course, compulsory for Year 1 CHS students, is the college's attempt in instilling an appreciation of Asian Studies as a discipline among its students. It is usually preallocated to students alongside HSS1000 Understanding Social Complexity, and DTK1234 Design Thinking. <br> <br>

Live lectures (that are also recorded) last 1.5 hours every week, with each week's lecturer explaining various case studies around Asia. As usual, tutorials are conducted every fortnight, and last up to 1.5 hours each. <br> <br>

There is a reading list which, in theory, is required before every tutorial session. <br> <br>

<b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
Unlike its Social Sciences counterpart, HSS1000, this module is very example-driven. Throughout the module, various local contexts are described and analysed, which are then synthesised into key points. It's basically a field trip around the different countries, provinces, and towns of Asia. <br> <br>

One point that initially bothered me about lectures was Dr Yang Yang's insistence on delivering the perfect sentence, complete with a flawless voice rasp. This resulted in choppy speech, with her repeating various words repeatedly, with an example, and I quote verbatim: "In Lu-- Luan-- Lua-- Luang Prabang...". Thankfully she was no longer stumbling by the sixth week. No hate intended, I just found it to be a funny quirk. <br> <br>

On the topic of lectures, I found that the lecture quality wildly varied between, and even within, lectures. Here's an exemplar: The second lecture of the "Religion and Society" unit comprised of possibly the best and worst lectures in the entire course; of a guest speaker concisely outlining the transmission of Teochew Buddhist music with great clarity and precise statements, and Dr Yang Yang's religious veiling full of research questions but no answers. It could've been as good as her Luang Prabang lecture. And don't get me started on the second lecture of the "Social Inequalities" unit involving... dissecting the technical aspects of film? Okay, I get how lighting and cinematography can convey themes of social inequality, but the links weren't mentioned or even touched upon at all during the lecture. It randomly came out of nowhere. <br> <br>

At the beginning of the semester, the tutorial class was divided into four discussion groups A/B/C/D. One group will then present in each of the next few tutorial sessions. With my tutor Piya's cogence and charisma, I quickly got into the groove of tutorial sessions and managed to contribute productively in healthy and respectful debate (no matter how controversial my arguments were). <br> <br>

As Week 10 rolls around with the poster due, things may get hectic. The entire group is quite literally required to visit a neighbourhood and take a photograph of at least five of its major landmarks, with group selfie(s) as a proof of independent work. Our group literally spent an entire afternoon going around a big neighbourhood and snapping photographs, then had to still complete the write-up afterwards. <br> <br>

Thankfully, the poster was not as tough of an assignment as I had initially made it out to be, with a greater emphasis on the write-up as opposed to premium graphic design (at least, not among students). <br> <br>

Though I found this module engaging, and enjoyed the limited yet grounded scope of Asia, I personally am still uninterested in an Asian Studies minor. I want to finish up a humanities second major, and these CHS modules are bogging my progress. <br> <br>

<b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>
Was I forced to read this module? Yes. <br>
Would I choose not to read this module if given the choice? Yes. <br>
Was it fun and did I meet cool people? Yes!!! <br>
If you don't feel like putting in effort, just S/U it, I guess. <br>

<i>~you can literally finish this in one day</i> <br> <br>

<b>AY23/24 Semester 1</b> <br>
Lecturer: CFG Team <br> <br>

<b>Topics</b> <br>
1. Resumes and Cover Letters <br>
2. Personal Branding <br>
3. Global Mindset <br>
4. Interviews <br>
5. Internships and Networking <br> <br>

<b>Assessment Components and Timeline</b> <br>
Attend two lectures <br>
20% Canvas Quizzes (At least 12/20) <br>
10% NUS ConnectUS Account <br>
10% NUS IAAS Account <br>
20% VMock Elevator Pitch <br>
40% VMock Resume (At least 60/100) <br>
All of them due by Week 6/13. <br> <br>

<b>Objectivities</b> <br>
This module runs from Week 1 to Week 6, or Week 7 to Week 13. You can choose either schedule, though I chose to complete it from Week 1 to Week 6. <br> <br>

Materials are categorised into 6 sections, each of them to be completed every week. However, since they're pretty much all open-access on Canvas, this module can technically be completed on the first day of the semester (save the two in-person lectures, 1.5 hours each on Weeks 1/7 and 4/10). Each section has about 10-20 pages worth of material, and can be completed in under an hour. <br> <br>

The ConnectUS and IAAS accounts are very easy to set up, and though filling up details is mildly inconvenient, you can use these accounts later on to apply for internships. Same goes for the resume -- create it properly rather than haphazardly trying to fulfil the CFG completion requirements. <br> <br>

The Elevator Pitch is a meme -- just spend 1 minute talking. The score doesn't matter. <br> <br>

<b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
I found this module useful in understanding the professional working world -- though there is only so much one can learn about in theory. <br> <br>

<b>Objectivities</b> <br>
One live recorded lecture per week lasting 1.5 hours, one recitation + tutorial per week lasting 2 hours. <br> <br>

This module is usually taken by science students. <br> <br>

<b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
Good module with a dedicated teaching team, albeit scattered with traces of careless iteration. You can tell that the materials aren't updated from the previous batch, with the way some weeks have two diagnostic quizzes and others have zero, or the fact that lecture slides still contain old content. Dear teaching team, please proofread your papers and slides~! <br> <br>

Also, this module feels quite bloated with assignments. Every week, students have to attend a lecture, diagnostic quiz, Coursemology lecture recap, recitation (useless second lecture), tutorial, mission -- too many things to keep track of. Why not merge the quiz, lecture recap, and mission into one big weekly assignment for easier housekeeping? It feels... "extra", just for the sake of being "extra". <br> <br>

But hey, at least the department provided like 20 past-year papers for our revision every exam, which are themselves quite similar in structure and very predictable. Take notes, MA1100T~! <br> <br>

<b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>
Try your best and give this module a good shot. After all, coding is quite an essential skill nowadays. Also, you get to fulfill your general education requirements~! <br> <br>

And please make sure to claim your free 20% from Coursemology, quizzes, contest, and tutorial participation. <br> <br>

<i>~every idea is a good idea (except for yours)</i> <br> <br>

<b>AY23/24 Semester 1</b> <br>
Lecturer: DTK Team <br> <br>

<b>Topics</b> <br>
1. Introduction <br>
2. Systematic Creativity <br>
3. Empathise <br>
4. Do, Undo, Redo <br>
5. Evaluate with People <br> <br>

<b>Assessment Components and Timeline</b> <br>
35% Individual Learning Activities (ILAs) -- 5 x 7 <br>
35% Team-Based Workshops (TBWs) -- 5 x 7 <br>
30% Design Thinking Journal (DTJ) <br> <br>

<b>Objectivities</b> <br>
This course, compulsory for Year 1 CHS students, is the college's attempt in instilling an appreciation of design principles among its students. It is usually preallocated to students alongside HSS1000 Understanding Social Complexity, and HSA1000 Asian Interconnections. <br> <br>

Operating on a fortnightly schedule, pre-recorded videos outline a topic last up to 1 hour total every two weeks. Then, students are expected to complete the ILAs, which may be completed within varying times. One hour if you're lazy, and maybe three (idk) if you work hard. As usual, tutorials (TBWs) are conducted every fortnight, and last up to 1.5 hours each. <br> <br>

<b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
Honestly, this course was somehow actually pretty well-designed. Each fortnight's ILA videos and worksheet were actually pretty aesthetic, and TBWs are actually just really fun arts-and-crafts workshops with a flavour of design principles. <br> <br>

Personally, I just went into the course with the intention to S/U it (you can literally tell from this review). Without the pressure of grades, it's actually pretty fun. Imagine if this course was CS/CU ~ <br> <br>
