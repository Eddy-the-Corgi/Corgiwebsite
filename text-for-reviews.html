    <i>~you can literally finish this in one day</i> <br> <br>

    <b>AY23/24 Semester 1</b> <br>
    Lecturer: CFG Team <br> <br>

    <b>Topics</b> <br>
    1. Resumes and Cover Letters <br>
    2. Personal Branding <br>
    3. Global Mindset <br>
    4. Interviews <br>
    5. Internships and Networking <br> <br>

    <b>Assessment Components and Timeline</b> <br>
    Attend two lectures <br>
    20% Canvas Quizzes (At least 12/20) <br>
    10% NUS ConnectUS Account <br>
    10% NUS IAAS Account <br>
    20% VMock Elevator Pitch <br>
    40% VMock Resume (At least 60/100) <br>
    All of them due by Week 6/13. <br> <br>

    <b>Objectivities</b> <br>
    This module runs from Week 1 to Week 6, or Week 7 to Week 13. You can choose either schedule, though I chose to complete it from Week 1 to Week 6. <br> <br>

    Materials are categorised into 6 sections, each of them to be completed every week. However, since they're pretty much all open-access on Canvas, this module can technically be completed on the first day of the semester (save the two in-person lectures, 1.5 hours each on Weeks 1/7 and 4/10). Each section has about 10-20 pages worth of material, and can be completed in under an hour. <br> <br>

    The ConnectUS and IAAS accounts are very easy to set up, and though filling up details is mildly inconvenient, you can use these accounts later on to apply for internships. Same goes for the resume -- create it properly rather than haphazardly trying to fulfil the CFG completion requirements. <br> <br>

    The Elevator Pitch is a meme -- just spend 1 minute talking. The score doesn't matter. <br> <br>

    <b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
    I found this module useful in understanding the professional working world -- though there is only so much one can learn about in theory. <br> <br>

    <b>Objectivities</b> <br>
    One live recorded lecture per week lasting 1.5 hours, one recitation + tutorial per week lasting 2 hours. <br> <br>

    This module is usually taken by science students. <br> <br>

    <b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
    Good module with a dedicated teaching team, albeit scattered with traces of careless iteration. You can tell that the materials aren't updated from the previous batch, with the way some weeks have two diagnostic quizzes and others have zero, or the fact that lecture slides still contain old content. Dear teaching team, please proofread your papers and slides~! <br> <br>

    Also, this module feels quite bloated with assignments. Every week, students have to attend a lecture, diagnostic quiz, Coursemology lecture recap, recitation (useless second lecture), tutorial, mission -- too many things to keep track of. Why not merge the quiz, lecture recap, and mission into one big weekly assignment for easier housekeeping? It feels... "extra", just for the sake of being "extra". <br> <br>

    But hey, at least the department provided like 20 past-year papers for our revision every exam, which are themselves quite similar in structure and very predictable. Take notes, MA1100T~! <br> <br>

    <b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>
    Try your best and give this module a good shot. After all, coding is quite an essential skill nowadays. Also, you get to fulfill your general education requirements~! <br> <br>

    And please make sure to claim your free 20% from Coursemology, quizzes, contest, and tutorial participation. <br> <br>

    edit: The worst offender of deprecated syllabus content is the teaching team telling me to download like 9 Python packages before never using them again, because that one Week 13 Data Visualisation topic got scrapped~ <br> <br>

    30% Design Thinking Journal (DTJ) <br> <br>

    <b>Objectivities</b> <br>
    This course, compulsory for Year 1 CHS students, is the college's attempt in instilling an appreciation of design principles among its students. It is usually preallocated to students alongside HSS1000 Understanding Social Complexity, and HSA1000 Asian Interconnections. <br> <br>

    Operating on a fortnightly schedule, pre-recorded videos outline a topic last up to 1 hour total every two weeks. Then, students are expected to complete the ILAs, which may be completed within varying times. One hour if you're lazy, and maybe three (idk) if you work hard. As usual, tutorials (TBWs) are conducted every fortnight, and last up to 1.5 hours each. <br> <br>

    <b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
    Honestly, this course was somehow actually pretty well-designed. Each fortnight's ILA videos and worksheet were actually pretty aesthetic, and TBWs are actually just really fun arts-and-crafts workshops with a flavour of design principles. <br> <br>

    Personally, I just went into the course with the intention to S/U it (you can literally tell from this review). Without the pressure of grades, it's actually pretty fun. Imagine if this course was CS/CU ~ <br> <br>

    <b>THERE ARE PEER REVIEWS</b> (yay) <br> <br>

    <b>Objectivities</b> <br>
    This course, compulsory for Year 1 CHS students, is the college's attempt in instilling an appreciation of Asian Studies as a discipline among its students. It is usually preallocated to students alongside HSS1000 Understanding Social Complexity, and DTK1234 Design Thinking. <br> <br>

    Live lectures (that are also recorded) last 1.5 hours every week, with each week's lecturer explaining various case studies around Asia. As usual, tutorials are conducted every fortnight, and last up to 1.5 hours each. <br> <br>

    There is a reading list which, in theory, is required before every tutorial session. <br> <br>

    <b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
    Unlike its Social Sciences counterpart, HSS1000, this module is very example-driven. Throughout the module, various local contexts are described and analysed, which are then synthesised into key points. It's basically a field trip around the different countries, provinces, and towns of Asia. <br> <br>

    One point that initially bothered me about lectures was Dr Yang Yang's insistence on delivering the perfect sentence, complete with a flawless voice rasp. This resulted in choppy speech, with her repeating various words repeatedly, with an example, and I quote verbatim: "In Lu-- Luan-- Lua-- Luang Prabang...". Thankfully she was no longer stumbling by the sixth week. No hate intended, I just found it to be a funny quirk. <br> <br>

    On the topic of lectures, I found that the lecture quality wildly varied between, and even within, lectures. Here's an exemplar: The second lecture of the "Religion and Society" unit comprised of possibly the best and worst lectures in the entire course; of a guest speaker concisely outlining the transmission of Teochew Buddhist music with great clarity and precise statements, and Dr Yang Yang's religious veiling full of research questions but no answers. It could've been as good as her Luang Prabang lecture. And don't get me started on the second lecture of the "Social Inequalities" unit involving... dissecting the technical aspects of film? Okay, I get how lighting and cinematography can convey themes of social inequality, but the links weren't mentioned or even touched upon at all during the lecture. It randomly came out of nowhere. <br> <br>

    At the beginning of the semester, the tutorial class was divided into four discussion groups A/B/C/D. One group would then present in each of the next few tutorial sessions. With my tutor Piya's cogence and charisma, I quickly got into the groove of tutorial sessions and managed to contribute productively in healthy and respectful debate (no matter how controversial my arguments were). <br> <br>

    As Week 10 rolls around with the poster due, things may get hectic. The entire group is quite literally required to visit a neighbourhood and take a photograph of at least five of its major landmarks, with group selfies as proof of independent work. Our group literally spent an entire afternoon going around a big neighbourhood and snapping photographs, then had to still complete the write-up afterwards. <br> <br>

    Thankfully, the poster was not as tough of an assignment as I had initially made it out to be, with a greater emphasis on the write-up as opposed to premium graphic design (at least, not among students). <br> <br>

    Though I found this module engaging, and enjoyed the limited yet grounded scope of Asia, I personally am still uninterested in an Asian Studies minor. I want to finish up a humanities second major, and these CHS modules are bogging my progress. <br> <br>

    20% Final Project (~Week 13) -- 900 words <br> <br>

    <b>The Objective Stuff</b> <br>
    This course, compulsory for Year 1 CHS students (despair), is usually preallocated to students alongside HSI1000 How Science Works, Why Science Works and GEA1000 Quantitative Reasoning with Data, neither of which I read (based). It's a tour around the various disciplines categorised under the "Humanities" branch of CHS, including, but not limited to, Philosophy, History, Linguistics, and Theatre Studies. <br> <br>

    Lectures last 1h to 1h 30min every week, and are recorded, each covering the plot, themes, and ideas of a selected book (or tablets, whatever). I have no idea whether the selected text has to be read before, between, or after the lectures, because I speedread through everything (as I should). Tutorials are conducted every fortnight, and last up to 1.5 hours each. <br> <br>

    The reading list comprises of the relevant books and some other articles that I don't know about. <br> <br>

    <b>The Subjective Stuff</b> <br>
    It's finally time to say my opinions without sounding like a robot. This course is pretty decent. At the very least, I'm glad it didn't reach HSS1000 levels; the disciplines covered in this course are quite integrated without incredibly artificial discipline-of-the-week delivery. The lecturers did a decent job integrating historical texts with philosophical ideas about humans, featuring Chinese philosophers talking about language and linguistics... you get the idea. That said, this module is largely dominated by philosophy --- perhaps due to the very nature of philosophy itself. <br> <br>

    As usual, the price of trying to cater to a thousand students (rounded up) and conducting a tour guide through the humanities section of CHS is the inevitable focus on breadth over depth and watering down of content. Not that this is an easily fixable trade-off, or one that shouldn't be taken, anyway. I just needed to give the usual disclaimer for CHS mods. <br> <br>

    The biggest flaw of this course is probably its emphasis on delivering concepts and ideas rather than actually engaging with them in detail. Don't just accept ideas. Fight them! The worst offender of this, and the lecture that alerted me to this problem, was <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat</i>. Dr Cathay Liu is an incredibly fluent and engaging lecturer (the only lecturer I remember other than the theatre kid's weird lecture/play/skit), and probably couldn't do much because this text was shafted and allocated just one lecture, but it really rubbed me the wrong way to have Carol Adams' ideas --- controversial ones --- be outlined and not discussed in sufficient detail. It felt like a mere report of facts and a proselytising session. "Meat bad! Meat bad!". Where's the balanced viewpoint? At least just give me a one-liner PLEASE. Can we also talk about how most idealism comes from a place of privilege? <br> <br>

    This brings me to my next point --- I would like a FULL DISCLOSURE of positionality for each lecture, especially for more controversial ones like <i>The Sexual Politics of Meat</i>. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE talking about language, erasure, psycholinguistics, the whole package. <i>1984</i> is awesome. I know meat has its destructive aspects. But I feel like a vegan in the teaching team just sneaked in their ideals in one lecture. This feels really wrong. REALLY wrong. I'm going to join the teaching team and add one lecture on why we should all be furries soon. Watch me. <br> <br>

    You know what? I just realised that writing these reviews really forces me to challenge module structures. I'm going to write more reviews. Fight ideas, right? <br> <br>

    <b>Tutor is King/Queen</b> <br>
    As usual. If you're going to read this course, just listen to the tutor --- their instructions supersede all others'. Hell, they have full control over your experience --- tailoring tutorial sessions, and by extension, the final project, to their specialty. I'm not going to write much about my tutor, because the tutorial experience is rather variable, and also in part because I've already written the important stuff in the official module feedback. <br> <br>

    <b>The Assessments</b> <br>
    Just fill in surveys (on Canvas) and peer reviews (on TEAMMATES) for free marks. Just complete your online reading tasks (on Perusall), usually asking or responding to questions, for free marks. Go to tutorials and just talk for free marks. <br> <br>

    Group Discussion Summaries, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. Since groups are pre-allocated, just pray for a good team, I guess. And be a good teammate. After every tutorial session, each group has to get together for a short 30-minute group meeting to expound and elaborate ideas and concepts outlined in lectures and tutorials, and summarise the meeting details within 400 words. These were... okay, I guess. <br> <br>

    The Online Quizzes are also a mixed bag, well, for me at least. They're pretty difficult, as evidenced by the fact that no one got full marks --- without negative marking and each question being T/F --- for all the quizzes (except for the first one, which is relatively short). These quiz questions are REALLY subtle. You get 3 attempts, so use each of them wisely. A good strategy is to have two attempts be identical, except one with TRUE and one with FALSE on the question that seems the hardest. You can try to --- and are in fact encouraged to --- challenge the answer key and argue with the teaching team, though I was too unbothered to do so. <br> <br>

    As for the final project, the topic and theme varies based on instructor. Expect yourself to reflect on your experiences and what you've learnt throughout the semester; record important things throughout the semester to make your life easier. Personally, I just used the most recent learning outcomes that I could remember. <br> <br>

    <b>THERE IS NO PEER REVIEW</b> (??? send help) <br><br>

    <b>Objectivities</b> <br>
    This course, compulsory for Year 1 CHS students, is the college's latest attempt in instilling interdisciplinarity in students. It is usually preallocated to students alongside HSA1000 Asian Interconnections, and DTK1234 Design Thinking. <br> <br>

    Pre-recorded lectures last 30 to 45 minutes every week, and can be viewed at any time, explaining simple concepts related to the discipline of the week. Live webinars which act as QnA sessions, conducted on Monday afternoons, last for 1 hour each, with students expected to spend up to 5 minutes afterwards to post a question on the online forum. Tutorials are conducted every fortnight, and last up to 1.5 hours. <br> <br>

    There is a reading list. <br> <br>

    <b>Subjectivities</b> <br>
    This module is basically a field trip to explore the various social science disciplines -- except any content coverage is highly surficial and watered down due to time constraints. I feel that this approach isn't particularly effective in making students genuinely appreciate the various disciplines CHS has to offer, though this may perhaps have been a task doomed to fail due to the module being compulsory in nature. If there was something to genuinely learn from this module, it would probably be general knowledge, ranging from conditioning methods to the mechanisms behind the failures of banks. <br> <br>

    Apart from the emphasis on breadth rather than depth, another aspect I didn't like was the weekly forum post. Though I do recognise the importance of open-ended and critical research questions, it felt very stifling and unrewarding to try to come up with an impressive and well-formulated question that would never be answered anyway. In total, there were around 750 students in the module, with 8 weekly forum posts. That amounts to 6000 questions, and 0 answers. <br> <br>

    Furthermore, I felt that the framing of critical questioning exercise wasn't presented too clearly. Throughout the module, the lecturers and tutors would consistently remind the students to "post the question online", without emphasising the difference between research and "casual" questions. After all -- not every question needs to be open-ended. At least, I hope "Is the homework due next Monday?" isn't too terrible of a question. In any case, the framing of the exercise is neglectful at best, and sinister at worst, potentially discouraging trivial binary questioning. <br>

    Unlike its sibling module HSA1000 Asian Interconnections, this module is explanation-driven, generally introducing concepts before fitting in the various case studies, especially the obligatory link to Singapore's context. This isn't inherently bad or worse, but is something to take note of -- you won't be learning about the instruments of Teochew culture transmission in 20th century Southeast Asia. <br> <br>

    <b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>
    This module certainly exists. <br> <br>

    If you already have a decent foundation in essay-writing, just put in the effort to ask decent open-ended research questions and write two relatively short analytical essays. <br> <br>

    If you feel that you are weak at essay-writing, just give it a try and see what happens, I guess. Having to hone your writing skills is an inevitability by hook or by crook, anyway. Or just S/U it if you're overloading in Semester 2. <br> <br>

    <b>There IS a peer review.</b> The group collectively decides each member's contribution in the form of a percentage (%). <br> <br>

    <b>The Objective Stuff</b> <br>
    This course is conducted almost exclusively on an own-time-own-target (OTOT) basis; all content and quizzes are available by the beginning of the semester. <br> <br>

    Lecture lengths vary. They can be as short as 40 minutes in total (introduction) to as long as 1h 30min in total (neural networks part 2). <br> <br>

    Tutorial is conducted once a week, and last up to 1 hour each. Attendance is compulsory. <br> <br>

    Everything is done on Coursemology; Canvas is a barren wasteland. <br> <br>

    <b>The Subjective Stuff</b> <br>
    Somehow an actually useful CHS module with valuable technical knowledge. Though treated at a surficial level, as expected from an introductory level 1000 module as opposed to its level 2000 and 3000 counterparts, it wonderfully serves its purpose of informing science students about the rough workings and details of AI and Machine Learning algorithms. You don't need crazy theory; you're just taught what Gradient Descent, for example, is helpful for and how to compute it. <br> <br>

    The project further reinforces this, providing students an opportunity to have a go at implementing AI. Groups aren't assigned, so find some reliable people. There are about ~20 possible projects to choose from, and they involve a wide variety of media such as CSV files, audio files, video files, etc --- this caters to both the uninitiated and AI-lovers. <br> <br>

    While this module is GOOD on the technical side, the delivery can be improved on. Notably, Prabhu needs to run everything he types through an English checker or GPT; I see numerous grammatical and spelling mistakes littered throughout the assignments and whatnot. Not that major of an issue, but not that minor either. <br> <br>

    Furthermore, there seems to be a 1-week offset between lectures and quizzes. For example, you'd have weekly quizzes testing concepts from the next week's lecture --- this is incredibly confusing. I just ended up putting off the quizzes until the next week. For example, on Week 9, I would complete the Week 9 Lecture and Week 8 Quiz. <br> <br>

    <b>Multiple-Choice Questions</b> <br>
    Exams are almost exclusively MCQ-based, with one or two computation questions here and there which require no intermediate working --- I suppose a measure to save the time and effort required to mark papers. While I'm fine with this, I'll need to let every fellow Linux user out there know that <b>Examplify</b> is required for the exams. I hope Jia Tan helps work on Examplify. <br> <br>

    <b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>

    <b>The Objective Stuff</b> <br>
    This course, Multivariable Calculus (read: the calculus of at most three variables with no mention of linear transformations from Rn to Rm), places great importance in computation of lines (1 variable) and surfaces (2 variables). While this isn't inherently bad, it'd be good material to cover, considering the fact that all contents were taught by the start of Week 12 --- three lectures' worth of content! <br> <br>

    Lectures last 1h 30min every week (twice), and tutorials 1h each. Out of the 11 or so tutorials, students must attend at least 8 of them to secure full marks for tutorial attendance --- 0.5% out of 4% every time you go to tutorial. Tip: Pick a convenient time slot and clock your attendance right before tutorial ends. Especially if your tutor just makes students sign on a piece of paper. You can alternatively present your solutions to three of the tutorial questions to clock 2 tutorials' worth of attendance. <br> <br>

    <b>The Subjective Stuff</b> <br>
    I don't know. I skipped lectures and went to tutorials five minutes before they ended. <br> <br>

    Other reviewers are mostly accurate; you need good geometric intuition and the bell curve is cursed. For reference, the upper quartile of the midterms was 45/50 (one mistake). <br> <br>

    Tips for triple integrals: I just defenestrated geometric intuition and bashed the inequalities: it's easier to replace the bounds that way. Or you can replace the bounds 2 variables at a time if you like to draw. <br> <br>

    <b>The Objective Stuff</b> <br>
    This course, Mathematical Analysis I (read: Real Analysis I), focuses almost exclusively on the reals as compared to the more metric-focused approach features in MA2108S, with metrics being relegated to a surficial treatment as part of the last section of the course. <br> <br>

    It starts off with the field axioms and completeness of the reals, using the Supremum Property (read: Axiom), that is, every nonempty subset of reals with an upper bound has a least upper bound in the set of reals. From there, it does some sequence acrobatics to obtain Cauchy Completeness (Cauchy implies convergent). And then some infinite series and continuity stuff, I guess. <br> <br>

    Lectures last 1h 40min every week (and are recorded), being 10 minutes longer than usual to make up for the absence of lectures during public holidays. Tutorials are conducted every week, lasting up to 1h each. Students are technically required to present their solutions as assigned. <br> <br>

    <b>The Subjective Stuff</b> <br>
    Wing Keung stutters a lot, and his lectures get very boring and sleepy. I skipped them and self-studied as per usual, checking each lecture recording for the appropriate section to stop off at. <br> <br>

    MA2108 starts off from a more concrete setting compared to its S-counterpart, both a boon and a bane. Personally, I liked the focus on the real line, since I've already worked in the more general setting of metric spaces before --- you really get to see the typical analysis tricks shine through. However, this concreteness comes at a price, namely, lower generality and weaker mathematical power. This abstraction-intuition tradeoff is pretty prevalent throughout all of mathematics. My stance: do both the abstract and the concrete. Since I've already worked in a more abstract setting ("top-down": topological spaces \rightarrow metric spaces \rightarrow real line), this concreteness ("bottom-up": real line \rightarrow metric spaces) value-added my understanding of analysis. <br> <br>

    <b>The Exams</b> <br>
    Wing Keung sets the same questions. Every. Time. This disproportionately rewards the grinders. Like me. <br> <br>

    Here's a typical final exam. <br>
    1) Limits. Two of them. Squeeze, factor, exponential limit, do your thing. <br>
    2) Some random rational-irrational piecewise function. Regurgitate the solution. <br>
    3) Convergence Tests. Two of them. Absolute/conditional convergence. One of them. <br>
    4) Some IVT question that involves defining a new function. <br>
    5) Some metric definition question, and using open set continuity. <br>
    6) Some epsilon-delta. <br>
    7) Some convergent recurrent sequence that requires contractive or MCT with induction. <br>
    8) Some limit of a floor function. <br>
    9) Question 6b. <br> <br>

    I mean --- I don't think the exam gets as (mentally) relaxing --- or rather, routine --- as this, even with a time crunch (my hands died scribbling down all the solutions). During exam preparation, I pretty much ONLY did Wing Keung's papers. I guess AXL and TWK have very different renditions of Analysis I --- this review is more aptly one for "Wing Keung's Mathematical Analysis I" rather than "Mathematical Analysis I". <br> <br>

    <b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>

    Tutorials: 1h a week. Optional. I skipped them. <br>
    No assignments. <br> <br>

    <b>The Subjective Stuff</b> <br>
    GFF needs to take some graphics design lessons --- for his lecture notes are in Times New Roman (or some other font to that effect) and his sections and subsections literally have the same size as regular text. <br> <br>

    He also needs to take some linguistics lessons --- for I tried clarifying the phrasing of a question during the midterms, and he just dismissed me with a quick "never do your tutorial". Hello sir, I do the tutorials. Multiple times. Maybe I forgot about the definition under the intense pressure of the examination? Be more tactful? <br> <br>

    I'm digging up the probability midterm right now to find the exact phrasing. The question is as follows: "In a freshly shuffled deck of 52 playing cards, what is the probability (correct to 2 decimal places of accuracy) that you are dealt a blackjack (an ace and 10, Jack, Queen or King)?" <br> <br>

    There are two (or perhaps more) possible interpretations of "an ace and 10, Jack, Queen or King". <br> <br>

    1) an ((ace and 10), (Jack), (Queen) or (King)) --- my initial interpretation; my immediate instinct having read widely <br>
    2) an ((ace) and ((10), (Jack), (Queen) or (King))) --- the intended interpretation; my guess based on how a game of Blackjack should flow (the ace and 10 from the first interpretation is an incredibly obscure combination that makes no sense, especially when it is somehow equivalent to just a Jack/Queen/King) <br> <br>

    Anyway, I ended up getting that question right so I'm less salty now. <br> <br>

    I think I heard my exam neighbour also ask that same question after I asked it. Methinks the professor should try to avoid syntactic and semantic ambiguities. I'm definitely not alone in this. <br> <br>

    <b>Ross</b> <br>
    Quite a boring textbook. Just way too many examples for my liking --- one section on continuous random variables had up to like 10 examples... as part of the main text. I personally think there should only be up to 2 or 3 salient examples per concept, with the rest of them relegated to the exercises section (which in Ross' case is actually pretty good). Don't like 30 pages being flooded by examples. <br> <br>

    <b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>
    Quite a useful and relevant module, possibly on par with CS2040 (for techbros), for finance-related interviews. <br> <br>

    Professor is annoying to deal with. To mitigate this, turn up to lectures at the exact one-hour-and-twenty-five-minutes mark (7:25pm) to do the in-lecture quiz/attendance (all of them can be solved in your head/ask around for answers). <br> <br>

    Optional tutorials and no homework is an upside. <br> <br>

    <b>The Objective Stuff</b> <br>
    Two lectures per week lasting up to 1h 40min each, and three tutorials per week lasting up to 1h each.

    <b>The Subjective Stuff</b> <br>
    The course follows DF very closely, with some Category Theory sprinkled in through Universal Properties. For an even more category-theoretic treatment, I've heard that <i>Algebra: Chapter 0</i> by Paolo Aluffi is a good read, though I've never checked it out myself. <br> <br>

    With respect to the amount of Category Theory involved in treating the Algebra, DF has the least, and Aluffi has the most; CCW's Algebra (still following DF) would be somewhere in between. <br> <br>

    <b>The Objective Stuff</b> <br>
    Unrecorded lectures last 1h 30min every week with laptops banned, with the author(s) of the week having their background, ideas, and arguments covered. The slides only have guiding questions; any salient point will come out of the professor's mouth. Because of this, it is advised for students to bring pen and paper for notetaking (or just use some digital tablet thing). <br> <br>

    Tutorials last 1h 30min as well, but are conducted by the man himself every fortnight instead. Out of all the pre-tutorial question submissions, the professor picks three of them to go through in great detail during the tutorial. Students typically spend 10 minutes discussing a question amongst themselves, before expressing their ideas and debating with the professor for... a long time. Rinse and repeat for the rest of the questions. <br> <br>

    The reading list is highly curated, all of it required reading, averaging about 20 to 30 pages each week. <br> <br>

    On Weeks 6 and 13, the midterm and final papers (respectively) are released to students in place of a lecture, with exactly one week for students to complete it. <br> <br>

    <b>The Subjective Stuff</b> <br>
    You can tell that Dr Lepori cares a lot about teaching. Each one of his decisions --- the laptop restriction, the pruned reading list, the atypical exam format --- have been consciously made (check Twitter). And yet, I think it would be fair to label this paternalistic. Excessively paternalistic? Maybe. <br> <br>

    Personally, I wasn't affected by the restriction on laptops at all, since I don't use a laptop to jot down notes during lecture in my other classes. In fact, I don't even watch lectures. Based. <br> <br>

    To echo the previous review, Dr Lepori neither expects nor wants students to use materials outside of the reading list. Combined with an extremely curated texts with carefully selected snippets, the reading load is extremely light. <br> <br>

    While 1200 word doesn't seem like a lot for essays, the midterms and finals each requires extreme concise and precise phrasing. As such, it may be quite different from the essays required in other courses. You're basically writing down a bunch of facts with an extremely tight word limit --- a measure taken against chatbots that tend to output flowery and longwinded language. <br> <br>

    5% Tutorial Participation <br> <br>

    <b>The Objective Stuff</b> <br>
    This course, typically taken by CHS students to fulfil their Writing pillar, requires one to become both a TED Talk speaker and a Guardian writer. Crudely speaking, you'll have to talk to the normies about sophisticated stuff by dumbing things down. <br> <br>

    There are no lectures --- you'll bid directly for the tutorial slot during ModReg, under the guise of "sectional teaching". Pretty similar to DTK1234. Tutorials are conducted once a week and officially allocated 3 hours, but to be honest, they'll probably be wrapped up within 2 to 2.5 hours. <br> <br>

    Before each tutorial, students are required to complete activities on an online Miro board and finish their pre-tutorial readings. In theory, that is. These requirements (especially the Miro board) eventually became more lax over time, making me question their necessity and effectiveness. <br> <br>

    <b>The Subjective Stuff</b> <br>
    Unfortunately, I didn't find this course too helpful, given that I already know how to speak and write to the normies. FFS, I know how to use similes and analogies. I know how to use evaluative language, too. I weasel my way out of arguments all the time like a sneaky politician. <br> <br>

    Furthermore, this course employs quite the rigid writing structure. You are, quite literally, expected to a follow a strict format in outlining a research paper. I mean, this rigidity is probably a decent guideline for novice writers --- as with the PEEL paragraph structure in high school --- but it just makes me annoyed. <br> <br>

    <b>My Suggestions</b> <br>
    Cover different styles of writing in a more nuanced manner. I would love to see something other than Hook-Summary-Background-Rationale-Methodology-Results-Society. And no, this wouldn't bloat the module's content. Not if you cut down on the weird stretch of five weeks in the middle of the term where every class literally just involved the same old repetitive dissection of science articles (albeit with different topics). There doesn't need to be one week dedicated to each of Biology, Mathematics, Chemistry, Statistics, Physics. We get the point, and we appreciate the practice in analysing science articles --- but five weeks is probably too much. Perhaps merge Mathematics and Statistics, or Chemistry and Biology? Or just remove Physics, it's just discount Math anyway (this is a joke, much like Computer Science). Or something. Cut it down to three weeks --- that'll be a good improvement. <br> <br>

    <b>Tutor is King/Queen</b> <br>
    As usual. Just permalisten to your tutor, and pray that they are good. I personally found my tutor quite based and dank. <br> <br>

    <b>The Saving Grace</b> <br>
    ...is the lack of lectures. I'm so glad that we get to interact and talk in tutorials for like two hours a week. I love talking. Bless. Like literally even if you don't learn anything you get to at least practise speaking and talking and defending your opinions and whatnot. <br> <br>

    <b>The Assessments</b> <br>
    Don't be intimidated by what seems to be a severe crunchtime during Weeks 12 and 13. Tutorial sessions end after ~Week 10 in order for students to work on their simultaneously-due Oral Presentation, Science Article, Reflective Commentary, and Peer Reviews. All you have to do is to work on your stuff early. Start on your presentation --- slides and all --- three weeks early. Make sure to finish up your Science News Article (and Reflective Commentary) quickly --- you'll probably be too exhausted after the oral presentation to do so. No script. TBH it was quite fun to become the Oshi no Ko and present my stuff. <br> <br>

    <b>Message to Prospective Students</b> <br>
    Too easy of a module if you're good at speaking and writing. <br>
    Don't get me wrong, it DOES serve its purpose of introducing students to popular science writing --- I just think it needs... more. <br> <br>
