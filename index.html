        <h2>[WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Hello Everyone!</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm <b><i>Martin</i></b>, a Year 2 undergraduate reading Mathematics at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
            <br> I'm a pretty disciplined guy with great problem-solving skills, and more importantly, I like talking a lot~!

    <section id="about">
        <h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a sprite addict, an Examplify victim, and a wannabe corgi. <br> Also an advocate of Linux and Dvorak supremacy.</p>

    <section id="interests">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently interested in <b><i>Applied Analysis</i></b>. Some fields that I'm looking at include optimisation, differential equations, stochastics, and probability theory. <br>

            On the side, I plan to dabble in some Algebra provided I can get through <i>Dummit and Foote</i> without sleeping, as well as Foundations. Especially Complexity Theory. <br>

            I also like collecting, or more aptly, eating up knowledge from the various fields charted by humanity. These include, but are not limited to: Economics, Evolution, Psychology, and Philosophy.
        </p>

    <section id="grades">
        <h2>Grades</h2>
        <p>
            My GPA is currently <b><i>4.93</i></b>, but it'll probably stabilise to the 4.70 to 4.80 range according to general trends. <br>

            My past grades include a score of 5 for the Ordinary Level (a rather unintuitive scoring system) and 89 out of 90 for the Advanced Level.
