    <h2>Interests</h2>

    I'm currently interested in Applied Analysis. Some fields that I'm looking at include probability theory, differential equations, and stochastic processes. <br> <br>

    On the side, I plan to dabble in some Algebra provided I can get through <i>Dummit and Foote</i> without sleeping, as well as Foundations. Especially Complexity Theory. <br> <br>

    I also like collecting, or more aptly, eating up knowledge from the various fields charted by humanity. This includes, but is not limited to: Economics, Evolution, Psychology, and Philosophy.

    <h2>Grades</h2>

    My GPA is currently 4.93, but it'll probably stabilise to the 4.70 to 4.80 range according to general trends. <br> <br>

    My past grades include a score of 5 for the Ordinary Level (a rather unintuitive scoring system) and 89 out of 90 for the Advanced Level.
